## Duplicate Instance Property 

* In the case of duplicate first Schedule Instance Properties:
    * $#### is appended to Schedule Name

##### Example:

* ```TIME=10``` and ```TIME=20``` are both shared
* ```$0003``` and ```$0004``` are appended to the Schedule names
* The numbers are assigned as the third and fourth Instances of the Daily Schedule Build
    * _Random Schedule Names can make utilizing Events difficult_
    * _Best Practice is to employ standardized naming conventions_
