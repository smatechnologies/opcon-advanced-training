### Lab B

Each night Congo Online Retail needs to run a 3-step process:

* Run a nightly batch Job closing out the business day for all of Congo Online Retail.
    * Use the same ```Timeout``` command as the previous Lab.

* Run a follow-up report for each of the major U.S. warehouses containing the individual warehouses’ production.  

    * This is a Multi-Instance Job.  

    * Use the same warehouse IDs and Paths as the previous Lab.  

    * Run a Job that distributes each of these reports. 
        * Use the same ```Timeout``` command in the previous Lab.

Use either the ```genericp``` program or the DOS ```Timeout``` command for **Jobs 1** and **3**. 

Use the same Embedded Script used in **Lab 1A** for the **2nd Job** to pass **Job Instance** values for the warehouse ID and Path.
