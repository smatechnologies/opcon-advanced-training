## Property Expressions - Arithmetic

Property Expressions allow arithmetic to alter Property Values

### Usage:

* Add two sets of Totals together to get a Grand Total
* Increment Property: ```+1``` every time a Job runs successfully

### Examples:

* Start a token with an equal sign to specify that an Expression is used
* Place the equation in parenthesis ```( )```

```[[=1+5]]```

The token will be resolved to a value of ```6```

### Longer Example:

```	[[=(1+5)/2]]```

The token will be resolved to a value of ```3```
