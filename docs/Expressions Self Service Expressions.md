### OpCon SMA Self Service Expressions

Both the **Hide** and **Disable** features in SMA Self Service can be driven by Expressions

This allows multiple ways to disable buttons:  

* Disable when a Button is pressed  
* Disable all Buttons for a Department  
* Disable all Buttons within SMA Self Service  

The value of the Global Property must be set to true to release functionality
